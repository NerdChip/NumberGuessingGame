# NumberGuessingGame
Number guessing game I created to improve my python coding skills. The game consits of a user having 8 attempts to guess the randomly generated number, the program will inform you if your guess is too high or too low. Fail to guess the correct number in the allowed turns then you lose the game, if you win you get to look at a picture of a cat- who doesnt love cats.
